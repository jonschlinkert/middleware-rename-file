## Usage

This can be used with [assemble][], [verb][], [generate][], [update][] or an other library that is based on [templates][].

**.onLoad**

The main export is a plugin function that automatically creates an `.onLoad` middleware that will run against every file. 

```js
var templates = require('templates');
var app = templates();
app.use(require('{%= name %}'));
```

The `.onLoad` stage is used to ensure that files are renamed before rendering, in case file paths need to be on the context at render time.
