## How it works

You can rename the destination path of a file using properties defined in its front-matter. Any of the path properties on a [vinyl][] file should work.

**Example**

Given the source file, `scaffolds/layouts/base.hbs`:

```html
---
rename:
  basename: default.hbs
  dirname: templates
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{{title}}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {%% body %}
  </body>
</html>
```

The generated destination path would be, `templates/default.hbs`.


## Usage

This can be used with [assemble][], [verb][], [generate][], [update][] or an other library that is based on [templates][].

**.onLoad**

The main export is a middleware function that should be passed to `.onLoad` to ensure that files are renamed as early in the render cycle as possible (so that when rendering begins, the actual file names are available on the context).

```js
var rename = require('{%= name %}');
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();

app.onLoad(/\.md$/, rename());
```

In addition to the regex provided to `.onLoad`, you may also optionally pass a filter function to `rename()`:

**Example**

Don't modify a file with the name (stem) `index`:

```js
app.onLoad(/\.md$/, rename(function(file) {
  return file.stem !== 'index';
}));
```
